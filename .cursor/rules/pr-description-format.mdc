# PR Description Format

Whenever you are asked to write, draft, or generate a pull request description (including title and body), output the result inside a fenced markdown code block:

```markdown
## Summary
...
```

- The code block must contain the full PR description — title, body, and all sections
- Do not split the description across multiple blocks
- Prose commentary (e.g. "here is your PR description") may appear outside the block, but the pasteable content must be entirely inside it
